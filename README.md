## PartFS: A FUSE filesystem for accessing part of a file. ##

PartFS is an in-development filesystem that lets a user mount a part of a file
as a virtual file, with a user-specified offset and length.

This allows a user to access a single partition in a larger disk image, as
well as other similar tasks.

PartFS is a work in progress. Expect to see changes added soon.
